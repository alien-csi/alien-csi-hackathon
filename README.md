# Covid restrictions (2022-02-01)

For the conditions for travelling to Romania see this link (in Romanian, unfortunately) https://fiipregatit.ro/sectiune_ghid/conditii-intrare-in-romania/ and this one in English https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/ROU/7011.

To my understanding, the new conditions for travelling (starting today, 1st of February) are as follows: when coming to Romania (from any country) you DO NOT have to quarantine if you are vaccinated, or you've had COVID in the last 6 months or you have a negative RT-PCR test (72 h before) > you have a mandatory green certificate (or compatible official documents);

You **do need to fill in a passenger locator form** (https://plf.gov.ro/login) and to download the digital COVID certificate (for the QR code) https://certificat-covid.gov.ro/login.

It is mentioned on the first website that individuals from countries whose authorities do not issue EU COVID-19 digital certificates or documents compatible with such certificates shall provide proof of vaccination, testing or cure by means of a document, either in paper or electronic format, issued by their respective country, in the language of that country and in English.

Recognition of COVID certificates from third countries (outside the EU)
So far, 33 countries (and territories) outside the EU have joined the EU digital certificate scheme on COVID. Certificates issued in these 33 countries (and territories) are accepted in the EU under the same conditions as the EU COVID digital certificate. Similarly, the EU COVID digital certificate is accepted by these 33 countries: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Cape Verde, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Georgia, Israel, Iceland, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Togo, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay, Vatican.

This is just a translation of what is presented on our national emergency situation platform (https://fiipregatit.ro/sectiune_ghid/conditii-intrare-in-romania/ ).
Be careful about the cancellation policy when booking flights, accommodation etc.. I have no idea how long these measures will be in place, so we have to keep an eye out.

P.S. Apparently quarantine is mandatory for people that are not vaccinated, have not had COVID in the last 6 months, do not have a RT-PCR negative test (72 h prior), have been in direct contact with a COVID positive person, or are COVID positive themselves.
