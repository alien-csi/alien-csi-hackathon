## Concept

We will develop a computer vision tool that will be able to identify images with sessile benthic invertebrates (beasties on the seabed that don't move) in, and report were in the image, and how many there are, and where feasible their basibiont associations (the beasties the aformentioned beasties are sitting on).

* *Austrominius modestus* (barnacle)
* *Crepipatella dilatata* (gastropod mollusc)
* *Crepidula fornicata* (gastropod mollusc)

## Methodology/Plan

1. Build a training dataset of images with target epibiont species in (e.g. barnacles) | and training datasets with target basibionts (?)
2. Learn how to build an object detection algorithm in python and/or R
3. Train detector on training data
4. Test detector on a hold-out validation dataset
5. Test the detector on a real-world problem
6. Write up results as a blog

## Data availability

- Do we have an existing image library we can use to build the training data?
- Is there a 'real-world' data set we can try the detector on once built (iNat maybe?)

## Outputs

- Training dataset
- Detector
- Results from real-world test
