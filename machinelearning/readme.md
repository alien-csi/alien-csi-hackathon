## Concept

We will develop a computer vision tool that will be able to identify images with barnacles in, and report were in the image, and how many there are.

* *Austrominius modestus* (barnacle)
* *Crepipatella dilatata* (gastropod mollusc)
* *Crepidula fornicata* (gastropod mollusc)

## Methodology/Plan

1. Build a training dataset of images with barnacles in 
2. Learn how to build an object dection algorithm in python and/or R
3. Train detector on training data
4. Test detector on a hold-out validation dataset
5. Test the detector on a real-world problem
6. Write up results as a blog

## Data availability

- Do we have an existing image library we can use to build the training data?
- Is there a 'real-world' data set we can try the detector on once built (iNat maybe?)

## Outputs

- Training dataset
- Detector
- Results from real-world test
